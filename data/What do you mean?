Where'd the love go?
Where's the passion, oh?
Why's it feel like
I'm better off alone?
Say it's my fault
That we're broken [Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth, babe
What should I do, babe?
I wanted you but I don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all [Chorus]
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you [Verse 2]
Where did we go from here
Did we throw it all away
Guess the end is finally near
There's nothing left to say
You got me open, now we are broken
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken [Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth babe
What did I do babe
I wanted you but I just don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all (at all) [Chorus]

Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you [Verse 3]
When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?
If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?
It's all good, it's all g
'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me
In the meantime, girls be around me
And I was so lost, until you found me
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you
I'm doing better without you, you, you [Chorus]
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh (so much better)
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh (woah)

I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, tripping on you)
With you with you oh without you [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see
I'm the only guy that you need
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this
Don't text, take a deep breath
'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey
Baby, don't stress
Stress out over me [Verse 1]
So when I invite you
Baby don't shy, oh
Open your mind, don't knock it till you try it, darling
Show of, when you come closer
Don't waste no time, I need it every minute darling
Oh, believe in me
Guaranteeing in my loyalty
How many times you don't want me to leave?
Want me to leave, no [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see

Stress out over me [Verse 2]
Oh, oh, no

From the bottom to the top to (?)
No need to turn up

Every (?) will achieve
Don't hesitate to follow my lead
How many times you don't want me to leave?
You don't want me to leave, no [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see (only girl I see)
I'm the only guy that you need (I'm the only guy that you need)
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this, want this

So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah
Oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby take it slow so we can last long Oh, tÃº, tÃº eres el imÃ¡n y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
SÃ³lo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso
Oh, yeah Ya, ya me estÃ¡ gustando mÃ¡s de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mÃ¡s
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningÃºn apuro Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oÃ­do
Para que te acuerdes si no estÃ¡s conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube) Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseÃ±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
DÃ©jame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido Si te pido un beso, ven, dÃ¡melo
Yo sÃ© que estÃ¡s pensÃ¡ndolo
Llevo tiempo intentÃ¡ndolo
Mami, esto es dando y dÃ¡ndolo
Sabes que tu corazÃ³n conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba estÃ¡ buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cÃ³mo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuÃ¡nto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, despuÃ©s salvaje Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tÃº me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquÃ­ tengo la pieza
Â¡Oye! Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oÃ­do
Para que te acuerdes si no estÃ¡s conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube) Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseÃ±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
DÃ©jame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, "Â¡Ay, Bendito!"
I can move forever cuando estÃ© contigo
Â¡Bailalo! Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseÃ±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (DY)

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself For all the times you made me feel small

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls? 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much

I see it happening everyday, nothing lasts forever
That's what people say
I can't picture you out of my life
I think about this every day and night
And I don't know why but it seems to get to me
No, I don't wanna leave you, I'm no good alone
So I'm staying with you till you want me to go Girl, you don't understand what you do to me

I'm in love, I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm, I'm in love Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again Just a fraction of your love
Fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again, woo woo woo
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me,
Is if you weren't here, whoa I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't face this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Common denominator
Oh, yeah, woa Before you're love was low
Playing girls was my high
We chase the game that would put
My cot in the side, aye
When broken hearts rise up to say,
Love is a lie
You and I would stand to be love's reply Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't face this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Common denominator
Oh, yeah, woa I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give, can fill me up
And to all the heart aching
Jealous females hatin'
Imma hold it down for you, you
You, woah, oh, woah
You're the common denominator
Oh yeah woah I don't wanna go back
I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't face this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Common denominator
Oh, yeah, woa Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name

So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss

That I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality

And when you hold my hand
Then I understand

So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure I'll show you
I'll show you Lately I've been thinking,thinking about what we had
And I know it was hard, it was all that we knew,yeah! Have you been drinking, to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do, yeah! You know there's no one, I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me, together I gave you everything babe
Well, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be Tell me, was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me, together There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me, together You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision

And I pray I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
Its in the papers, its on the TV,
Its everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray I lose my appetite,
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner,
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference
And its starting today 'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven tell me how I can make a change I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and
Pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray
Can you give 'em one today
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell how to make a change? I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and I pray I pray
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
'Cause I know that a piece of you's gone,
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall, In love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless, unless you let yourself fall Mark my words, that's all that I have

Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving

If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling? (Oh) (Oh) You give to me

Say it's my fault
That we're broken [Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth, babe
What should I do, babe?

Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion, deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh my Like a permanent stain
Wishin' I could just wash away
Away
And our love was in vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain? If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant
Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
Been you There are percussions, I'm missing your loving
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the time Like a permanent stain
Wishin' I could just wash away
Away
Hate or love was insane
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain? If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant
Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
Been you If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant
Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
Been you [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see
I'm the only guy that you need
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this
Don't text, take a deep breath
'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey
Baby, don't stress
Stress out over me [Verse 1]
So when I invite you
Baby don't shy, oh
Open your mind, don't knock it till you try it, darling
Show of, when you come closer
Don't waste no time, I need it every minute darling
Oh, believe in me
Guaranteeing in my loyalty
How many times you don't want me to leave?
Want me to leave, no [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see
I'm the only guy that you need
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this
Don't text, take a deep breath
'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey
Baby, don't stress
Stress out over me [Verse 2]
Oh, oh, no
Let's take it slow
From the bottom to the top to (?)
No need to turn up

Every (?) will achieve
Don't hesitate to follow my lead
How many times you don't want me to leave?
You don't want me to leave, no [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see (only girl I see)

'Cause I don't need you to stress
I don't need you to stress out over me, hey hey
Stress out over me
Baby, don't stress over me Believe, believe, believe I don't know how I got here
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now 'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if, if you didn't believe
Believe There were days when I was just broken, you know
There were nights when I was doubting myself
But your kept my heart from foldin'
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
And just look at us now 'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if, if you didn't believe Where would I be, if you, if you

Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop
'Cept for the clock on the wall
And I'm scared you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas I'm praying that you make it home tonight

I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
'Cause I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that, that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that, I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because, because people aren't perfect and
By not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
So I, I just get my recognition from Him
And give Him recognition Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I won't let the night stand in my way yeah
I know what I want, I know what I get, yeah
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is lay down next you 'Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one love
'Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one love
Baby give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight See I've made mistakes time after time, time, time
But no not today, won't leave 'til I find what I'm looking for
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is dance under the moon 'Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one love
'Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one love
Baby give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight Your love is like a roller-coaster
The way that you take my breath away
It feels like I'm slowly falling deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper 'Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one love (I don't need nobody else)
'Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one love
Baby give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body

'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody can give it to me

Catching feelings

Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free
Yeah Where are you now
Where are you now
Now that I'm half grown
Why are we far apart
I feel so alone Where are you now
When nothings going right
Where are you now
I can't see the light So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free , Yeah I need you
To need me
Can't you see me
How could you leave me
My heart is
Half empty
I'm not whole
When your not with me
I want you here with me
To get me, hold me and love me now Where are you now
Oh, where are you now So take my hand and walk with me,
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free
Yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah 
I'm alone above the atmosphere
And no one looking up can find me here
'Cause I can close my eyes and disappear

When I climb the stairs to watch the sun
Above the station walls the colors run
To fill the swimming pool when I am done

I am the captain of an oil tanker that travels through your veins

When the satellites hang all around
And I can finally hear a lovely sound
When all the engines in the back room die down

All the airships move across the sky
And my equipment just keeps standing by
The planets glow and intensify

I am the pilot of a cargo airplane that travels through your veins

When you are lying half-asleep in your room
Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon

Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell
It could be raining but then you can never tell

If you're alone in this awful downpour
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door

In the evening light the boulevard
Conceals the night with disregard
For all the workers in a west coast ship yard

When I rearrange the silverware
And re-install the lights in captain's chair
I'll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air

I am the engineer of forty freight trains that travel through your veins

When you are lying half asleep in your room
Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon

Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell
It could be raining but then you can never tell

If you're awake in this awful downpour
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door

When you are swimming in Miami at night
I'm all around you in the traffic and city lights

I am stuck in L.A. through the week and cant get away
And you're alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy nights, re-awake the stomach ache
That I've acquired, from feeling down
Things look grim and I'm so sick of being tired

Apartment lights go dark and its depressing
But what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you

Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize

If you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you

Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
And think of me when you explore hidden coves
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still, hear my voice
When I'm outside, from over the phone?

For what it's worth, darling dear
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
When you were home we'd sing
But since you've left I dont hear anything
Though I feel so sad
I can't believe things are really that bad

Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea
When I crashed my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris

I'll cut loose leave this mad house
Bound for the Atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
And sail the ocean with you

Affection, the gifted architect,
Is making a draft and beautiful design
The options and possibilities
Are endless when we connect and re-align

Collections of books and documents
Arise and parade around my cluttered desk
Reworking the math and measurements
Until I'm convinced these plans are picturesque
Like mountains in the Midwest

Reaction creates the columns dark
And wide like the roads around Fort Lauderdale
The structures begin to take their shape
Before I've designed the public monorail

The turnpike and high-speed motorway
Connect and enclose the quaint suburban streets
The airport, the broad suspension bridge
The lake and the beach where several rivers meet
Compounded from the spreadsheet

A city sparkles in the night
How can it glow so bright?
The neighborhoods surround the soft florescent light
Designer skyline in my head
Abstract and still well-read
You went from numbered lines to buildings overhead

I'm moving to Tokyo
Cuz I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos can reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the navy yards
With hard working security guards
Cuz the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stay
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath the snowy veil
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale

When I am fast asleep
I dream and see you floating high above me
And I awake at dawn
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
From on the bedroom floor
I watch you sailing far above the seashore

In deep Atlantic skies
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
Above the avenue
I search among the clouds, trying to see you
But you are just a blur
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor

I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you
When I'm out on the bay
You're aloft in the airway

When I'm alone at night
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight
Suspended in the air
I wish your silhouette would always stay there
When I am on the beach
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach

But I can not take flight
Or float upon the air the way that you might
When I am in the sea
You gazed down from the sky, trying to see me
But I am just a blur
Through the waves, as I scuba dive below the harbor

The airway
You and I in the airway
Aloft in the airway
In love on the airway

I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you
When I'm out on the bay
You're aloft in the airway

If I could look across the country
From California to New Jersey
Then I would count the parks and lake resorts
And number all the jets and airports
All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me
Cause I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see

If I could open up my window
And see from Tampa Bay to Juneau
Then I would survey all those open miles
And line them up in single file
Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime
And all those oceanic vistas are so divine

If I was standing on the balcony
And you were walking down below
I'd feel rather depressed and out of place
And lonely just to watch you go
If you were swinging from the highway overpass
Within the western hemisphere
I'd feel rather afraid and insincere
If you began to disappear

If I was walking through a sad art gallery
And you were driving through the night
I'd feel rather alone and ill at ease
Beneath the brilliant showroom light
If I was flying on a plane above your town
And you were gazing at the sky
Somehow I'd feel intact and reassured
If you began to wave goodbye

Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
Cuz I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye...

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?

High rise, veins of the avenue
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you
Street lights glisten on the boulevard
And cold nights make staying alert so hard
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?
Small town hearts of the New Year
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear
City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier
Make haste, I feel your heartbeat
With new taste for speed, out on the street
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins
'Cause your heart has a lack of colour and we should've known
That we'd grow up sooner or later 'Cause we wasted all our free time alone

Your nerves gather with the altitude
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway
The high tide could take me so far away
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age
'Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align.

We were the crashing whitecaps
On the ocean
And what lovely sea-side holiday, away
A palm tree in Christmas lights
My emotion
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone
As we spent the day alone

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins
'Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known
That we'd grow up sooner or later 'cause we wasted all our free time alone

Glamour and fashion
Models and magazines... a striking runway entrance
Beauty and passion
Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens
When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire
With ribbons in her blonde hair
I still remember
She was like a princess straight from a dreamy castle in the air

So lovely...
She was everything to me

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon

I was the youngest son of a congressman
And everything was my fault...
She was a gymnast, happily swinging
On the uneven bars, tucked in a somersault

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon

I opened my eyes last night
And saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
Staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore

I was feeling the night grow old
And you were looking so cold
Like an introvert,
I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before...

... you happened to look and see
The tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound

To my motion fatigue farewell,
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves
In underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep,
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep

I feel as if I were home some nights,
When we count all the ship lights.
I guess I'll never know
Why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights
And set this ballroom aglow

(So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time)

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Time together is just never quite enough
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time

Good evening, shuttle bus! Tell me where you're going to take us
Someplace that I have never been
It's chic transportation to new destination where I leave my reflection on the glass
I'd ask but we don't know how far these interstates go
Or how deep the city roots go down
In chilly sub-depth railways, the weathered concrete stairways provide me with a means of getting home... if I ever leave

On crystal sand, we sleep hand-in-hand
While soothing words hover like hummingbirdsThe bird is here and we are off to wherever those wings take us
The atmosphere is crawling with airlines
That wind through the clouds and look down on the crowds

Relax your back and let the noise sing you to sleep in my arms
If you awake before we arrive I will carry you down and I won't make a sound

The scent is strong as we move on and breathe in the pristine crime scene
The false veneer is old like a substitute volunteer from, oh, some other year

I'm just a shell as far as I can tell, so I paint my eyes a light green
The silver beams are twirling and swirling throughout your dreams like air traffic streams

I am the red in the rose, the flowers
on the blankets on your bedroom floor.
And I am the gray in the ghost that hides
with your clothes behind your closet door.

I am the green in the grass that bends back
from underneath your feet.
And I am the blue in your back alley view
where the horizon and the rooftops meet.

If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors
of the evening stars.
You can go anywhere you wish 'cause I'll be there, wherever you are.
(wherever you are) [2x]

(I will always meet your gaze)
when we are lost in the technicolor phase)

I am the black in the book
the letters on the pages that you memorize.
And I am the orange in the overcast
a color that you visualize.

I am the white in the walls that soak up
all the sound when you cannot sleep.
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach
that wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep.

If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors
of the evening stars. (my darling)
You can go anywhere you wish 'cause I'll be there, wherever you are.

I stood up and took a breath and threw open the bay doors
Below the clouds I saw the coast and beautiful Hawaii
Leaning back, the pilot smiled and shouted,
"Have a good trip!"
I signed off and closed my eyes.
Then I was falling through the sky

I regarded the world as such a sad sight
Until I viewed it in black and white
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape
And sealed the exits with caution tape
Don't refocus your eyes in the darkness
And don't remember this place unless
I describe all the things that you cannot see
And we'll unravel the mystery

Farewell, all my friends in textbooks, I'm going home
Cuz my blood cells cannot depend on the weather in photographs
There's a light show out my window somewhere way up there
Dear Vienna, are you singing?
Dear Vienna, are you swinging?
Dear Vienna, we were happy like the shades of May when we got carried away

I was so far out of place
Watching those stars in outer space
Cuz I am so far from where you are

If we could sit together a moment
And talk forever just to pass the time
I would smile as the shivers and chills run down my spine
When your eyes are locked on mine

Oh we'll fill the metro skies with country air
And when you close your tired eyes I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there

I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there

Deep inside of you there's a ruby glow
And it gets brighter than you and I will ever know
There's a rushing sound that surrounds us when we walk alone
And it's everything we've never known

Wander down the street
And I would be the pavement beneath your feet
If we could just be immobile for some time
And finally figure out the way we feel
About the missing puzzle pieces and cloudy question marks
That still look a bit surreal

Oh I tend to disappear here and there
So concentrate and you'll feel me everywhere
And we'll fill the metro skies with country air
If you're lost when you close your eyes I'll meet you there

I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there

You could be anywhere
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
You could be anywhere
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
Open your eyes and see
You could be anywhere
Everything you can be
I'll meet you there
Open your eyes and see
You could be anywhere
Everything you can be
I'll meet you there

Wake up on your own
And look around you 'cause you're not alone
Release your high hopes and they'll survive
'Cause this is the future and you are alive

Dive in and swim away
From your lonely nights and miserable days

And when you wake up on your own
Look around you 'cause you're not alone
Let your hopes go and they'll survive
'Cause this is the future and you are alive
You're headed home,
You're headed home

Are you out there
Where the rainy days begin
To feel rather sad
And the walls are closing in
Like the darkness around me
It's so hard to look away
When the daylight doesn't ever stay
Above this dull apartment view
Oh, I will surround you

It's quite clear that I'm stuck here
So I'll devise a plan
And cut out a door in my new living room floor
The porch light is so bright
That I will quickly sneak down the dark metal shape
Of the rusty fire escape

I bought a one way ticket
Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
And we were going down
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
The warm water took me by surprise
And I woke up beside the ocean
I realized I must be in California

Aloha, my happy west coast friends
Do you feel alive
When the breaking waves arrive
And wash all around you
The beach homes and ocean side
Are quite well known by the evening tide
And we can sleep where we reside
With redwoods around us
The blue air is up there
And could I bring it down
I bottle it up and save it for a sweet summer night

I bought a one way ticket
Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
And we were going down
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
The warm water took me by surprise
And I woke up beside the ocean
I realized I must be in California
I must be in California

Am I awake or is this just a dream?

The new year is out here
And I will make a lovely list
Of your charms
So I'll never feel alone in your arms

I must be in California
I must be in CaliforniaPlease take a long hard look
Through your text book 'cause I'm history
When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone
'Cause I've been dying to leave
Yeah, I'll ride the range
And hide all my loose change in my bedroll
'Cause riding a dirt bike down a turn pike
Always takes its toll on me

I've had just about enough
Of quote "diamonds in the rough"
Because my backbone is paper thin
Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
(or I'll cave in, or I'll cave in...)

If the bombs go off the sun will still be shining
(The sun will still be shining)
Because I've heard it said that
Every mushroom cloud has a silver lining
(Though I'm always undermining too deep to know)
Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop
'Cause the road tastes like Wintergreen
The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane
Mixed with stale gasoline

I'll soak up the sound
Try to sleep on the wet ground
I'll get ten minutes give or take
'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy
When cold integrity keeps me wide awake
(Awake, awake, awake, awake...)

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
(Cave in, cave in, cave in, cave in...)

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in

I'll keep my helmet on
Just in case my head caves in
(In case my head caves in)
'Cause if my thoughts collapse
Or my framework snaps
It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe
Tie my handle bars to the stars
So I stay on track (so I stay on track)
And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away
Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back

I won't even look back

If you're the bird
Whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm
I know the part, it's such a bummer

But fair is fair
If my segments get separated
I'll scream
And you'll be there

Close your eyes
(Close my eyes)
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder
And feel the shine
(Feel the shine)
I'm hooked so toss me over
And cast a line
(Well, I'll try)
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends
(It depends)
As they arrive
(If they arrive)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well,
Who needs enemies?

If I'm your boy
Let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy
Picking apples in late September like
We've done for years
Then we'll take a long walk
Through the cornfield
And I'll kiss you
Between the ears

If you're my girl
Swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl
The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
'Cause we tend to make
Each other blush
(you make me blush)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well,
Who needs anemones?

You're the bird, I'm the worm
And it's plain to see
That we were meant to be

We were meant to be
We were meant to be
(If you're the bird,
If you're the bird,
Then I'm the worm)
We were meant to be

Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
In the hills and highlands
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
And awake in your mouth

Hello Seattle, I am a manta ray
Deep beneath the blue waves
I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound
And construct a summer home

Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon
Shining down on your face
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
And descend inside of you

Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse
Feeling warm in your sand
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf
Rolling in the evening breeze

Hello Seattle, I am an albatross
On the docks and moored boats
I sail above your inlets and interstates
Through the rain and open wind

Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse
Throwing beams of bright lights
Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun
Taking heed for everyone

Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
In the hills and highlands
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots

Take me above your light
Carry me through the night
Hold me secure in flight
Sing me to sleep tonight

Take me above your light (Hello Seattle)
Carry me through the night (I am a mountaineer, in the hills and highlands)
Hold me secure in flight (I fall asleep in hospital)
Sing me to sleep tonight (parking lots)

Stems and gears, oh how the daisies bloom
When chandeliers light up the engine room
Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain
There's an underwater Ferris wheel
Where I found the missing link to this island chain

Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly

Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under an umbrella beach

Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly

I'll spread my wings and fly

Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under an umbrella beach

I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore, staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore
I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
So like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently
Before you happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound
To my motion fatigue, farewell with your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

Can you believe that the crew has gone and they wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep, and I can hardly relax or even oversleep
But I feel warm with your hand, in mine, when we walk along the shoreline
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow

So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
Yeah, all the time, all the time

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time
Oh all the time

I brush my teeth, and look in the mirror
And laugh out loud as I'm beaming from ear to ear
I'd rather pick flowers, instead of fights
And rather than flaunt my style
I'd flash you a smile, of clean pearly whites

I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill
I smooth my hair, sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills

"Have a seat" he says pleasantly
As he shakes my hand, and practically laughs at me
"Open up nice and wide" he says peering in
And with a smirk he says "Don't have a fit, this'll just pinch a bit"
As he tries not to grin

When hygienists leave on long vacations
That's when dentists scream and lose their patience

Talking only brings the toothaches on,
Because I say the stupidest things
So if my resolve goes South
I'll swallow my pride with an aspirin, and shut my mouth

Golf and alcohol don't mix
And that's why I don't drink and drive
Because, good grief I'd knock out my teeth,
And have to kiss my smile goodbye

I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill
I smooth my hair, sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills

I can finally see that You're right there beside me
I am not my own, for I have been made new
Please don't let me go I desperately need You

I am not my own, for I have been made new
Please don't let me go I desperately need You

Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
Cuz I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye...

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude
But I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
(Thread, thread...)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
(Ha-ha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(Jar, jar, jar...)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams


Welcome back
Winter once again
And put on your warm fuzzy sweater
'Cause you'll feel much better when

The snowflakes fall
Gently to the ground
The temperature drops
And your shivers freeze all the rivers around
But I keep you warm

If speed's a pro
Inertia must be a con
'Cause the cold wind blows at precise rates
When I've got my ice skates on

If all the roads
Were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska
Then on to Alaska and back
'Cause you keep me warm

Peer over the edge
Can you see me?
Rivulets flow from your eyes
Paint runs from your mouth
Like a waterfall
And your lungs crystallize

I'll travel the sub-zero tundra
I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes
And that's just the tip of the iceberg
I'll do whatever it takes
To change

Farewell powdery paradise
We'd rather skate on the thinnest ice
Fingers failed us before they froze
And frostbite bit down on all our toes

Snow drifts build up and enfold us
As we wait out this winter storm
So we snuggle close in the darkness
And keep each other so warm
The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere

'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you, dear
'Cause I wish you were here

I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly

The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers
Are right where yours fit perfectly

I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone

But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist deep in thought because when
I think of you I don't feel so alone

I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone

As many times as I blink
I'll think of you tonight

I'll think of you tonight

When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again

And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh, if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your ear,
"Oh, darling, I wish you were here."
I wish I could cross my arms, and cross your mind
Cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve
All my life I wish I broke mirrors, instead of promises
Cause all I see, is a shattered conscience staring right back at me
I wish I had covered all my tracks completely cause I'm so afraid
Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train?
Lift your arms only heaven knows, where the danger grows
And it's safe to say there's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way
(Help is on the way, Help is on the way, Help is on the way...)

Help is on the way
I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
Cause it came down like a tidal wave, and sorrow swept over me

Depression, please cut to the chase and cut a long story short
Oh please be done. How much longer can this drama afford to run?
Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then, all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again
(Back down again, back down again, back down again...)

I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
Cause it came down like a tidal wave, and sorrow swept over me
Then I was given grace and love, I was blind but now I can see
Cause I found a new hope from above, and courage swept over me

It hurts just to wake up, whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside, so tired of looking in
The end is uncertain and I've never been so afraid
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope
And that makes me feel brave
We wrote a prelude to our own fairytale
And bought a parachute at a church rummage sale.
And with a mean sewing machine and miles of thread
We sewed the day above L.A. in navy and red.

We round a racetrack through your mom's kitchen chairs
And fought the shadows back down your dark basement stairs.
I lit a match and let it catch to light up the room.
And then you yelled as we beheld an old maroon.

Hot air balloon.

I'll be out of my mind,
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind,
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.

We drank the Great Lakes like cold lemonade.
And both got stomach aches sprawled out in the shade.
So bored to death you held your breath and I tried not to yawn.
You make my frown turn upside down and now my worries are gone.

I'll be out of my mind,
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind,
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.

I'll be out of my mind,
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind,
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.
If i was a raindrop
would you be my thunderstorm?
It's cold so surround me
With rain clouds to keep me warm
I feel like I'm falling
So darling don't let me go
The thought is appalling but should I slip away
Into the stormy sea will you remember me?

Asleep in a warm cocoon
We dream of lovely things
We're both gonna wake up soon
So we hope that tomorrow brings
Us our butterfly wings

If i was a grain of sand
Would you be Miami Beach
So dusty with starlight
Close your eyes and cuddle close to me
I'll try not to wake you
Or make a sound while you're dozing off
But in the night should the high tides sweep me away from you
Tell me again my dear will you be waiting here?

Whenever we leave the ground
And take to the sky
I'll smile as I'm gazing down
Cause I've always wonder why we won't need feathers to fly
Toupee or not toupee
That is the question
It refused to stay as it all turned grey;
William Shakespeare's receding hair
Please excuse the pun,
'It's hair today, gone tomorrow'
So be thankful
For what precious locks you have

Toupee or not toupee
That is the question
And by the way
I just gotta say
Thank the Lord I'm not going bald
And if I may quip
My curls and I
Are just like heaven
'Cause rest assured
There'll be no parting there

But should my head get bare like Friar Tuck
(Our chase to swallow)
It makes me smile
'Cause I know just what I'd do

Yeah if I had more wigs than I knew what to do with
I'd open a secondhand store
And if you ever went bald
You'd recall it
'Cause I'd cleverly call it
'Rugs From Me To You'
So there we were, back home from somewhere inside my head
Oh, bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed
Pillars of postwar books supported my frame of mind
While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide behind
She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me
The lantern died that night but we didn't need to see
Implying that she's the bee's knees and I am the cat's meow
It's funny how she recalls what I can't remember now

But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on, played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
I got a sunburn

So there we were out there, unaware of where we'd been
We kicked off our flip-flops and swung from the rooftops again
It's awkward but I'll confess she's all I can think about
And it's funny how I recall what she can't remember now

But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on, played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn

Oh, afterglow, look out below
We left a trail of dust behind
As we parted ways, she held my gaze
And left an imprint on my mind
I tried not to cry as we said goodbye
And hung the clouds above my town
But I shed a tear when she disappeared
Cause now I'm a stranger on the ground

When her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack
We both put our sunblock on, played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
But she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
She got a tan, and I got a sunburn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
You're the sky that I fell through
And I remember the view whenever I'm holding you
The sun hung from a string
Looking down on the world as it warms over everything
Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine
And your sighs harmonize with mine
Unmistakably
I can still feel your heart
Beat fast when you dance with me

We got older and I should have known
(Do you feel alive?)
That I'd feel colder when I walk alone
(Oh, but you'll survive)
So I may as well ditch my dismay
(Bombs away... Bombs away...)

Circle me and the needle moves gracefully
Back and forth, if my heart was a compass you'd be North
Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall
Wherever you go, if my heart was a house you'd be home

It makes me smile because you said it best
I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the west
Flower balm perfume, all my clothes smell like you
Cause your favorite shade is navy blue

I walk slowly when I'm on my own
(Do you feel alive?)
Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone
(Oh, but you'll survive)
So I may as well ditch my dismay
(Bombs away... Bombs away...)

Circle me and the needle moves gracefully
Back and forth, if my heart was a compass you'd be North
Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall
Wherever you go, if my heart was a house you'd be home

If my heart was a house, you'd be home
This is a world of dreams and reverie
Where I felt the stars explode around me
A grass blade flashed with a gleam as it slashed open a moonbeam
And I stared back breathlessly
As mountains of fruit tumbled out I barely had the chance to shout
Oh strawberry avalanche, crash over me

Staying awake that night was rather hard
Deep in a sleeping bag in your back yard
When we woke up buried alive
Beneath the fruity landslide
We both laughed hysterically
It could've been just another dream
But, I swear I heard you scream
Oh strawberry avalanche, crash over me

Hope is a citrus constellation in the galaxy
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids
That I've been dying to see

If you were a beautiful sound in the echoes all around
Then I'd be your harmony
And we'd sing along with the crowds
Beneath the candy coated clouds
Oh strawberry avalanche please crash over me

This is a world of dreams and reverie
Where I felt the stars explode around me

I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street,
take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet.

You blushed as they scooped you up on sugar maple wings,
to gaze down on the city below, ablaze with wondrous things.

Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn’t want to live there.

I wouldn’t wanna live there!

Weighed down by heavy lids and lunar lullabies,
I knew you were wide awake because you smile with your eyes.

Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn’t want to live there.

From the green belt balcony, the wildfires look so pretty.
Ponderosa canopy, I’d never leave if it were up to me.
To the ruby redwood tree, and to the velvet climbing ivy:
painted all mahogany, I’d never leave if it were up to me.

..If it were up to me..

With a starry brush, paint the dusk venetian blue,
because in the evening hush, you’ll never believe the view.
And when the leaves return and their whisperings fill the night,
they’ll freeze and burn where fire and ice collide.

Can you feel a silk embrace in the satin air?
If we dissolve without a trace, will the real world even care?
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn’t want to live there.

I wouldn’t want to live there!

I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street,
take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet.

Met a girl in the parking lot,
And all I did was say hello.
Her pepper spray made it rather hard
For me to walk her home,
But I guess that's the way it goes.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.

Met a girl with a graceful charm,
But when beauty met the beast he froze.
Got the sense I was not her type
By black eye and bloody nose,
But I guess that's the way it goes.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.

It's suffocating to say,
But the female mystique takes my breath away.
So give me a smile or give me a sneer,
'Cause I'm trying to guess here.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
I'm sorry I ever tried, deer in the headlights.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
If life was a game, you would never play nice.
If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes.
Put your sunglasses on 'cause you're a deer in the headlights.

You're the deer in the headlights.
You're the deer in the headlights.

Wake me if you're out there

Through the glass in my bedroom window
In the bushes far below
I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow
Among the ones I so clearly know

I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says, "I'm dreaming of the life I once loved,
So wake me if you're out there."

Living close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
So wake me if you're out there!

Wake me if you're out there

In the dust on my cellar staircase
A pair of footprints followed me
I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace
Blinked again but there was nothing to see

I've been leaving all the windows unlocked
With a basket by the oak tree
'Cause I'll be pickin' up the acorns that fall off
If you'll be climbing up to meet me

Living close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
Wake me if you're out there

I keep my knees black and blue
'Cause they often hit the hard wood floor
(Wake me if you're out there)
And I believe so
I'm not praying to the ceiling anymore

I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says, "I'm dreaming of the life I once loved,
So wake me if you're out there."

Living close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts

The indications reveal
(Wake me if you're out there)
That few of us realize life is quite surreal
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity
Splash down in the silver screen
Into a deep dramatic scene
I swim through the theater
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer
Like a kite in the bright midday
Wonder stole my breath away
Shy sonata for Mercury
The stars always sing so pretty

[Chorus:]
This picnic will soon depart
Real life, I'm sad to see you go
I'll miss you with all my heart
But I'd rather be alone
'Cause I couldn't live without
Sunsets that dazzle in the dusk
So I'll drag the anchor up
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust

Dreams don't turn to dust!

[Verse 2]
I made for the countryside
And my eyes never grew so wide
Apple raspberry river blue
I don't wanna leave without you
In the sound I gladly drowned
Into the emerald underground
I rub my eyes 'cause it's hard to see
Surrounded by all this beauty

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
(I'm sad to see you go)
(But I'd rather be alone)

When tiger eyes begin making you blush
And when diamonds boast that they can't be crushed
Let 'em go, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust

[Chorus]

Dreams don't turn to dust!
Dreams don't turn to dust!
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust!
Don't remind me
That some days I'm a windshield
And other days I'm just a lucky bug
As cold iron rails leave
Old mossy trails through the countryside

The crow and the bean field
Are my best friends but
Boy, I need a hug (boy, I need a hug)
'Cause my heart stops without you
There's something about you
That makes me feel alive

If the green left the grass on the other side
(I would make like a tree and leave)
But if I reached for your hand
Would your eyes get wide?
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)

Don't remind me
I'm a chickadee in love with the sky
But that's clearly not a lot to crow about
'Cause when the stars silhouette me
I'm scared they'll forget me
And flicker out

I taste honey but I haven't seen the hive
Yeah I didn't look, I didn't even try
But still my heart stops without you
'Cause there's something about you
That makes me feel alive

If the green left the grass on the other side
(I would make like a tree and leave)
But if I reached for your hand
Would your eyes get wide?
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)

We are honey and the bee
Backyard of butterflies surrounded me
I fell in love with you
Like bees to honey
So let's up
And leave the weeping to the willow tree
And pour our tears in the sea

I swear there's a lot of vegetables out there
That crop up for air
And yet I never thought
We were two peas in a pod
Until you suddenly bloomed
Then I knew
That I'd always love you
(Oh, I'll always love you too)

If the green left the grass on the other side
(I would make like a tree and leave)
But if I reached for your hand
Would your eyes get wide?
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)
If the green left the grass on the other side
(I would make like a tree and leave)
But if I reached for your hand
Would your eyes get wide?
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)

And if I reached for your hand
For the rest of my life
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)
The princess in her flower bed
Pulled the jungle underground
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbird's red
And explosions never make a sound

Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down

My captain on the snowy horse
Is coming back to take me home
(Is coming back to take me home)
He'll find me fighting back the terrible force
'Cause I'm not afraid to die alone

Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down

Oh, comet come
(Oh, comet come down)
(down)

(Break down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Bring in the ember glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With an eagle eye

(Break down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Bring in, bring in the ember glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With an eagle eye
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)

Ladies and Gentlemen, today is a day for mourning and remembering.
They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths,
And they had that special grace, that special spirit that says:
"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy."
The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.
Call back the cap com
Tick off the time bomb
Let felicity fly

Armor the air lock
Blanket the bed rock
And kiss the planet goodbye

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far

Da da da da da dada da

Fight back the flight deck
Bring on the break neck
Cue the solar eclipse

Summit the sunset
Dovetail the dragnet
And blow your backbone to bits

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far

Oh telescope
Keep an eye on my only hope
Lest I blink and get swept off the narrow road
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need
For He is the saving grace of the galaxies (galaxies, galaxies, galaxies, galaxies)
He is the saving grace of the galaxies (galaxies)

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far

I would follow this far

(Through the galaxy)

Da da da da da dada da
I survived
A dreadful accident
In the car crash of the century
My shattered hopes
Collapsed on cold cement
But in the back of the ambulance
I never felt so content

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight
To me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me
Through a grave emergency

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da

I tossed and turned
In sterile apathy
Until the violets
Arrived for me
The bouquet burst
And blossoms filled the room
And the place got smaller as they grew taller
And taught me to bloom

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight
To me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me
Through a grave emergency

The curtains decayed
The daylight poured in
I was never afraid
Of the darkness again
My burns were third-degree
But I'd been set free
Cuz grace had finally found its way
To me

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight
To me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me
Happiness returned to me
Happiness returned to me
Through a grave emergency

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
(Through a grave emergency)
Da da da da
Da da da da
Happiness returned to me
Through a grave emergency
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky
Even though, I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go

[Shawn Chrystopher - Rap Verse 1:]
Uh uh, that's not a plane, that's me
I'm sittin' where I'm supposed to
Floatin' on the cloud, can't nobody come close to
The concrete and the sky switch places
So now my ceiling is painted with cosmic spaces
Firecracker to the moon, keep your eyes shut
Blastin' off like a rocket from the ground up
Heh, I used to catch a cab on the Monday
Now the taxi's sellin' lights on the runway, fly high
Condo on the milky way
A house on the cloud and God's my landlord
And for my rent all I pay is my drive
Got that so If you need me you can find me in the alligator sky

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go

Rollercoaster through the atmosphere
I'm drowning in this starry serenade
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier
My imagination's taking me away

Reverie whispered in my ear
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid
Rollercoaster through the atmosphere
My imagination's taking me away

[Shawn Chrystopher - Rap Verse 2:]
Uh, now I'mma dance like I never danced
Sing like I never sing, dream like I've never dreamed
Or-or tried to, 'cause we've been lied to
That the sun is somethin' that we can't fly to
Well, I sit on my star and see street lights
Look up, ha, you'll miss me if you blink twice
Imagination is high and if you got it you can meet me
When you see me in the alligator sky

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go

Where was I when the rockets came to life (boom)
And carried you away into the alligator sky? (like a rocket from the ground up)
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead (never know)
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go

Never letting go
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
Look up, ha, you'll miss me if you blink twice
In the alligator sky

My rock candy passion is bittersweet
And armed to the teeth
Cuz she would rather fall in chocolate
Than fall in love
Especially with me

I stood under the waterfall
With a kiwi-pineapple parasol
As Cinderella dropped the crystal ball
And made a concrete cavern
A caterpillar concert hall

I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

I would rather go swimming
With great white sharks
Than wade in romance
Cuz I can never find the courage
To ask her to dinner
Or even to dance
(Dance in the moonlight)

Don't sweat under your overcoat
Cuz my heart can harbor this paddle boat
You'll hit the bottom of the highest note
And the chatty tree frogs will never wanna
Leave your throat

I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da

Let go of the world you know
And plug in the partyin' lights
Soak your cares in the solar flares
That light up these island nights
Orange eclipse I can taste your lips
In the citrus afternoon
If you can fly don't stop at the sky
Cuz there's footprints on the moon
(With you)

I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club
I saw a ghost on the stairs
And sheets on the tables and chairs
The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink
Even so, I don't know, what to think

I've been longing for
Daisies to push through the floor
And I wish plant life would grow all around me
So I won't feel dead anymore
So I won't feel dead anymore

I saw a bear in the den
Reading my textbooks again
Bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic
Heaven knows, I could really use a friend

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?

I've been longing for
Daisies to push through the floor
I've never really felt like this before
And I wish plant life would grow all around me
So I won't feel dead anymore
So I won't feel dead anymore

Your spirit is sweet, so pull off your sheet
And give me a ghost of a smile
Show me your teeth, 'cause you're a teddy beneath
So just grin and bear it a while
Just grin and bear it a while

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?

The brook babbles on about nothing at all
A new leaf turns over, unwilling to fall!

Tonight I'm busting out
Of this old haunted house
'Cause I'm sick of waiting for
All those spider webs to grow all around me
'Cause I don't feel dead anymore
And I'm not afraid anymore

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?
June was the lobster shell
I dug by hand
A haven that hid me well
Beneath the sand
The wide windy waves washed in
But I stayed dry
The great breakers broke again
As I nodded off inside

And then
When the Empress ran aground
And my eyes turned blue and green
I heard a gorgeous sound
And that's when it became a dream

When the sky fell in
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea

I wrenched the engines off
And drank them down
The depths turned the iron soft
As they swiftly drowned
And I brought the ocean side
To its rusty knees
As I felt the even tide
Deep in my shallow dreams

And then
When the Empress ran aground
And my eyes turned blue and green
I heard a gorgeous sound
And that's when it became a dream
When the sky fell in
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea

When the sky fell in
(When the sky fell in)
(When the sky fell in)
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
That's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
That's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
(How I became the sea)

(When the sky fell in)
(When the hurricanes came for me)
(I could finally crash again)
(And that's how I became the sea)

(How I became the sea)
Symphony of silver tears,
Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears,
Overcast these gloomy nights wear on,
But I'm holding fast because it's darkest just before the dawn.

I sang my princess fast asleep,
'Cause she was my dream come true,
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.

But now those lonely lullabies,
Just dampen my tired eyes,
Because I can't forget you.
Because I can't forget you.

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,
When the nightmares take me,
I will scream with the howling wind,
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.

Dizzy love turned a star lily pink,
And hung above our lids too flushed to blink,
But icy blue froze the fairytale cold,
Though I treasured you and you sparkled with someone to hold.

I sang my princess fast asleep,
'Cause she was my dream come true,
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.

But now those lonely lullabies,
Just dampen my tired eyes,
Because I can't forget you.
Because I can't forget you.

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,
When the nightmares take me,
I will scream with the howling wind,
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,
When the nightmares take me,
I will scream with the howling wind,
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.
And I'd rather dream.

Annmarie, I'll never forget you.
Annmarie, I'll never forget you.
Annmarie, remember me?
I'll never forget you.
Annmarie, remember me?
I'll never forget you.
Annmarie, remember me?
I'll never forget you.
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes

She dried my eyes and drifted off
While every tear was held aloft
The heavy rain clouds felt terrible
'Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful

Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes (Beautiful)
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes (Beautiful)
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes

Beautiful

'Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful.
Shipwreck in a sea of faces
There's a dreamy world up there
Dear friends in higher places
Carry me away from here

Travel light, let the sun eclipse you
'Cause your flight is about to leave
And there's more to this brave adventure
Than you'd ever believe

Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
And take to the sky (you take to the sky)

On the heels of war and wonder
There's a stormy world up there
You can't whisper above the thunder
But you can fly anywhere

Purple burst of paper birds
This picture paints a thousand words
So take a breath of myth and mystery
And don't look back

Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
And take to the sky (you take to the sky)

There's a realm above the trees
Where the lost are finally found
So touch your feathers to the breeze
And leave the ground

Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
And take to the sky
(you take to the sky) [2x]
Close your tired eyes, relax and then
Count from 1 to 10 and open them
All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down
But not this time

Way up in the air, you're finally free
And you can stay up there right next to me
All this gravity will try to pull you down
But not this time

When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight

Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are tonight

Gaze into my eyes when the fire starts
And fan the flames so hot it melts our hearts
Oh, the pouring rain will try to put it out
But not this time

Let your colors burn and brightly burst
Into a million sparks that all disperse
And illuminate a world that'll try to bring you down
But not this time

When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight

Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are tonight

A thousand heart beats beat in time
It makes this dark planet come alive
So when the lights flicker out tonight
You gotta shine

When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight

Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight.
Stand on up and take a bow
There's something there and it's showing
There's no need to look around
You're the best we got going

Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
Nothing's gonna stop you now
I guess you better be going

You'll never be far, I'm keeping you near

Go on, it's gotta be time
You're starting to shine

'Cause what you got is
Gold, I know, you're gold

All I need is you by my side, so shine forever
Gold, I know, you're gold

It won't take you long to get when you feel like you're soaring
So write it all and don't forget, you gotta tell us your story

Shout out to the friends back home
Shout out to the hearts you've known
You gave them nothing but the best, yeah
And you can tell them your story

You'll never be far, I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart, you're here
Go on, it's gotta be time
You're starting to shine

'Cause what you got is
Gold, I know, you're gold

All I need is you by my side, so shine forever
Gold, I know, you're gold
Oh, I know, you're gold

'Cause what you got is
Gold, I know, you're gold
Oh, I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night, I found my treasure
All I need is you by my side, so shine forever
Gold, I know, you're gold
Oh, I know, you're gold

You're gold
You're gold!
(Dementia, you're driving me crazy
This is driving me crazy,
Dementia, dementia)

Every light in the night flickered in and out
Every bone in my back shivered up and down
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Every voice in my head shouted 'yes' and 'no'
Every freight train of thought fought to stop and go
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy

(Dementia, you're driving me crazy,
This is driving me crazy)

Every tear in my eyes dripped and wouldn't drop
Every disc in my spine shook and couldn't stop
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Every hand let me go that I tried to hold
Every warm-hearted love left me freezing cold
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
(Dementia, you're driving me crazy)
(Dementia, you're driving me crazy)

This is driving me crazy
(You're driving me crazy)
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, dementia

Through the skies you're en route at the speed of light
So realize there's chaos in the air tonight
This is love, this is war, this is pure insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy

This is driving me crazy
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
'Cause this is driving me crazy
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
(This is driving me crazy)
(This is driving me crazy)
(This is driving me crazy)
(Dementia, dementia)
There was a shot in the dark, I was caught by surprise
There was a hole in my heart, there were tears in your eyes
And there was nothing to say 'cause you made up your mind
So I guess what you meant when you left was goodbye

So if you're gonna go and leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show until you've finally flown away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away

I felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek
And as I try to digest the words I couldn't believe
I'm left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve
Making it easy to hurt and even harder to breathe

So if you're gonna go and leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show until you've finally flown away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away

You take it all away, you take it all away, you take it all away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away
We were alone on the road driving faster
So far from home we were chasing disaster
Hard on the gas 'till the car caught on fire
We had to laugh as the smoked billowed higher
I wanna feel alive forever after
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after
And I, and I, and I say

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters

Think of the sun, and the sound of it rising
Still on the run with our eyes on the horizon

I wanna feel alive forever after
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after
And I, and I, and I say

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters

I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters!
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters!

I saw your face in a criminal sketch
Don't be alarmed 'cause you don't know me yet
I'm on the prowl now, sniffing around this town for you
Calling all cars, there's an officer down
Shot to the heart on the night on the town, and
The evidence of your fingerprints was found, and now

You got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you

Oh no, here we go once again
We both know you'll never turn yourself in
So I'm driving 'till it's light out, searching for your hideout
(Driving 'till it's light out, searching for your hideout)
Pick up the pace as I chase you around
One of these days I'll end up tracking you down
But yeah, I've got the feeling I'll be letting you loose when I do

Because you, you got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you

You got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
(Love is a high speed chase racing down the street)

You got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you

I'm coming after you
I'm coming after you!
I tried to disappear but you're the only reason I'm floating here
Eyes, painted crystal clear, I can see our future through the atmosphere

Don't you go, no don't you go
Don't you know, I'm up here alone
Yeah I am like a satellite, sending you a signal tonight

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up
Everybody's racing at the speed of love
(Do do do do do do)

You were so hard to find, with oh so many clouds across my summer sky
You, my constellation prize, yeah, every single star is sparkling in your eyes

So don't you go, no don't you go
'Cause don't you know, I'm up here alone
So high like a satellite, I'm sending you a signal tonight

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up
Everybody's racing at the speed of love

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up
Everybody's racing at the speed of love

One track, one mind, one race to win
One start, one heart, one life to live
One track, one mind, one race to win
One start, one heart, one life to live

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up
Everybody's racing at the speed of love

Everybody's racing at the speed of love!
Whoa-uh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-uh-oh
It's always a good time

Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I'll wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time (Whooo)

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I'll wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time (Whooo)

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
Doesn't matter where
It's always a good time there

Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then

It's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive
There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes
There were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark
And the fire brought me to life

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high
'Cause theres no other way we can stay alive

'Cause we're burning bright
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

And you'll find there'll be mornings
When the ashes and embers are cold
But you'll fight with a passion
And you'll never stop 'cause you know
Yeah you know, it gets better
And your story is yet to be told
Every push, every shove, every war, every love
Yeah, the coals are beginning to glow

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high
'Cause theres no other way we can stay alive

'Cause we're burning bright
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

Don't let the fire die
It gets better
Just don't let the fire die, no

'Cause we're burning bright (burning bright)
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky (watch the sky)
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die
Don't let the fire die.

I'm tired of waking up in tears
'Cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain

The fire I began is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
"Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?"
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

I'm sick of the past I can't erase
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace
The mountain of things I still regret
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget (no matter where I go)

The fire I began is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then (now and then)
"Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?"
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

'Cause I walk alone
No matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone
No matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone
No matter where I go

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then (now and then)
"Is it over yet? Will I ever love again?"
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

I watch the summer stars to lead me home.

Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in metropolis

So far apart, I checked but the coast was clear
I feel like a postcard
I wish you were here

Subway through the dark, carriage through the park
Taxi down the street, get out and use my feet
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home to you

Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in metropolis

A thousand miles feels like a million years
Like hundreds of postcards that say
I wish you were here (I can't even take it in)
Airplane through the sky, greyhound racing by
Dirt bike on the beach, sailboat on the sea
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home to you

Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in metropolis
I left my heart in metropolis

Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in metropolis
I left my heart in metropolis
I left my heart in metropolis
I left my heart in metropolis

Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in metropolis.

That blonde, she's a bomb, she's an atom bomb.
Rigged up, and ready to drop!
Bad news, I'm a fuse, and I've met my match.
So stand back, it's about to go off!

That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger, when I look in her eyes.
She's so foxy, she could lead to my demise.
So I'm running, 'cause I've run out of time.

I’m James Bond, live to die another day!

Her love is a drug laced with ecstasy,
And her charm is spiked with a spell.

It's my time, and right now, I'm going for it
It's my turn to take on the world
And right now, the sky is my only limit
Yeah, I'm ready to take on the world

It's my time, and right now, I'm moving forward
It's my turn to reach for the stars
And right now, it's cold, but I'm getting warmer
It's my turn to live on the edge
It's high time like dark days without an order
Yeah, I'm ready to take on the world

Oh, I'm a satellite,
Because I'm over the moon tonight
Oh, feeling so alive,

Yeah, I'm ready to take on the world

I must be in California



So many sights to see so wake up like an early birdie
And we'll get a head start on the day
Stained-glass skyways and crowded 6 lane highways
If I look back when I begin to leave, will they remember me?

Circuit flights bend the lights when I am spent
And tour guides make happy brides feel heaven-sent
A spark soaring down through the pouring rain
And restoring life to the lighthouse
A slow motion wave on the ocean
Stirs my emotion up like a rain cloud

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

A cab driver turned to skydiver
Then to survivor,
Dying to breakdown
A blood brother, surrogate mother
Hugging each other, crying their eyes out

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

I'm ecstatic like a drug addict
Locked in the attic
Strung out and spellbound

I fought all through the night
Oh, oh, but I made it alive
The sun's starting to rise
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times
This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

A bad feeling burned through the ceiling
Leaving my healing heart with a new scar
A dead fire rose and rose higher
Like a vampire, up from the graveyard

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

We all suffer but we recover
Just to discover life where we all are

I fought all through the night
Oh, oh, but I made it alive
The sun's starting to rise
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times
This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

My heart's burning bad
And it's turning black
But I'm learning how to be stronger
And sincerely, I love you dearly
Oh, but I'm clearly destined to wander

I fell in love with a ghost
Out, under the moonlight
You took my hand and held me close
For once I was alright

I cried and the tears fell from my eyes
Like a waterfall
And I swear I could feel you in my arms
But there was no one there at all

You were my clarity, I swear
All alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night
Whoa oh oh oh

It's tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind

I tossed and turned in the end
With no one to talk to
I searched again and again
But I never found you

I cried and the tears fell from my eyes
Like a waterfall
And I swear I could feel you in my arms
But there was no one there at all

You were my clarity, I swear
All alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night
Whoa oh oh oh

I'm gonna be up all night, whoa oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Its tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night

Whoa oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night, whoa oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Its tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind

You were my clarity, I swear
All alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night

(Gonna be up all night)
(And now I'm gonna be up all night)

A whisper on the air
Made my heart rate fall
When I heard you call
And I swear, I could hear your voice in my ear
But there was no one there at all
An eight year old girl had a panic attack
'Cause the father she loved left and never looked back
No longer the hero she counted on
He told her he loved her and then he was gone

She tried to look happy in front of her friends
But knew that she'd never feel normal again
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end

Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked
But nobody knew he was dying inside
He promised his family he'd be alright
And then with a gunshot he left them behind

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end, no.

The role of a father he never deserved
He abandoned his daughter and never returned
And over the years though the pain was real
She finally forgave him and started to heal

How close is the ending, well, nobody knows
The future's a mystery and anything goes
Love is confusing and life is hard
You fight to survive 'cause you made it this far

It's all too astounding to comprehend
It's just the beginning this isn't the end
It's just the beginning this isn't the end

It's another bad dream
Poison in my blood stream
I'm dying but I can't scream
Will you show me the way?

It's another wolf bite
Howlin' in the moonlight
I wanna get my life right!
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

Will you be there?
Toni-i-ight, toni-i-ight, i-ight
Ohwoho

[Chorus:]
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls
In my despair
Will you be there?
In the darkest night
When I need your light
Will you show me the way?
If my time runs out
And the sky falls down
Despite my fear
Will you appear?
If the world goes blind
And I lose my mind
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

Will you show me the way, tonight?
Will you show me the way, tonight?

It's another nightmare
I swear there's something out there
So save me cause I'm so scared
Will you show me the way?

It's another werewolf
All dressed up in sheep's wool
And changing when the moon's full
Will you show me the way?

[Chorus x2:]
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls
In my despair
Will you be there?
In the darkest night
When I need your light
Will you show me the way?
If my time runs out
And the sky falls down
Despite my fear
Will you appear?
If the world goes blind
And I lose my mind
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

In my despair
Will you be there?
Tonight

I ain't too sure what I believe in
But I believe in what I see
And when I close my eyes
I see my whole life ahead of me

These are our hours (These are our hours)
This is our time (This is our time)
This is our time
These are our hours (These are our hours)
Out on the verge (Out on the verge)
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives (The rest of our lives)

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

These are our hours (These are our hours)
This is our time (This is our time)
These are our hours (These are our hours)
Out on the verge
Out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

(For the rest of our lives)

From now on
There's no looking back
Full steam ahead
On this one-way track

From this day forward
I will make a promise
To be true to myself
And always be honest

For the rest of my life
I will do what's right
I will do what's right
When I step...

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives (The rest of our lives)

The rest of our lives
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
I was so young and reckless
It was all a blur but there you were
And your love left me breathless
When the fairy dust fell over us
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

So take my hand, and shed a tear
Before I'm gone, it's now or never
I'll hold you close, the end is near
But love goes on, and on forever

It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away

When the sparks, flew between us
I saw you glow, and had to know
Where our journey would lead us
Til' the story end, and back again
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

So lead me home, and lift me up
Above the stars, and even higher
I'm not afraid, because your love
It falls like rain, and burns like fire

It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away

I'll love you forever
And you were my dream come true
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love
[Owl City:]
I feel you glowing in the dark
When I collapse into your arms
I'm just a stranger in the stars

[Sarah Russell:]
Cause somehow it seems when I am with you
That all of my dreams begin to come true
And carefully you carry me away

[Owl City:]
I've never felt so wide awake
Cause I'm wonder struck
I love how you take my breath away
I'm thunderstruck
To tell you the truth, I'm so afraid
(I'm so afraid)
That I'm out of luck
I love how you take my breath away
(Take my breath away)
I'm thunderstruck

[Owl City:]
I chase the phantoms down the hall
I felt the floorboards rise and fall
I lost and never loved at all

[Sarah Russell:]
Cause I'm in a daze and you're in my dreams
The orchestra plays the prettiest things
And carefully you carry me away

[Owl City:]
I've never felt so wide awake
Cause I'm wonder struck
I love how you take my breath away
(Take my breath away)
I'm thunderstruck
To tell you the truth, I'm so afraid
(I'm so afraid)
That I'm out of luck
I love how you take my breath away
(Take my breath away)
I'm thunderstruck

[Owl City (Sarah Russell):]
Woah, I'm leaving the world behind
(And all my dreams,
All of my dreams are shared now)
Woah, I'm over the moon tonight
(And all my dreams,
All of my dreams are shared now)
Cause somehow it seems (when I am with you)
That all of my dreams (begin to come true)
And carefully you carry me away

[Sarah Russell (Owl City):]
You take my breath away
(Away)
When I'm with you
(I'm with you)
And all my dreams,
All of my dreams are shared now
(When I look at you)
All of my dreams are shared now
(When I look at you)
When my hope is lost
And my strength is gone
I run to you and you alone
When I can't get up and I can't go on
I run to you and you alone

'Cause you're my light in the dark
And I sing with all of my heart

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You're my everything

When I'm plagued with pain
And filled with fear
I run to you and you alone
When my days are few
And death is near
I run to you and you alone

'Cause you're my light in the dark
And I sing with all of my heart

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

When trouble comes and goes
And when the cold wind blows
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up
When sorrow knocks me down
And you pick me off the ground
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up
And I sing

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say

Hallelujah
By the grace of God above
Hallelujah
I'll shine a light 'cause I am loved
This is all I know I will say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You're my everything

Ohh Ohh, You're my everything
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-3PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the backseat of the bus
When I was a kid I ate Spaghetti-Os, played laser tag and G.I. Joes
And if you vowed "no girls allowed, " then you could join the club
When I was a kid I spent my Saturdays
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was "Lion King, " and I could feel the love

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

[Hanson:]
When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won't lie, my friends and I, were too legit to quit
When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees, ate Dr. Pepper jellybeans
My favorite part of "Jurassic Park" was how real the raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS, watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff
Zack Morris owned the first cell phone, and it was off the hook!

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

Gak, Pogs, and Floam, and "Home Alone, " "Berenstein Bears" and bean bag chairs
My L.A. Looks and Goosebumps books, oh Etch-a-Sketch
What happens next?
Grape Juicy Juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and
Slip 'N Slides, McDonald's fries, those were the best
What happens next?

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, those were the days oh-oh

It's unbelievable
When I think back I'm amazed
It's unbelievable
Cause baby those were the days
It's unbelievable
It ruled in so many ways
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

(It's so amazes)
(Those were the days!)

So I walk alone down the darkest roads
'Cause I've always known how the story goes
When the curtain falls, I'll be wearing thin
Clawing at the walls as they're closing in
In this twisted plot I was destined for
I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor
So misunderstood 'till the bloody end
How I wish I could do it all again

It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing

It's another night of the living dead
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb
It's so deathly dark in the alleyway
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey
I would run and hide for the afternoon
With the butterfly in the panic room
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time
For a different twist in the story line

It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing

It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing

Tell the world I know that my mind is made
It's a horror show, but I'm not afraid
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time
For a different twist in the story line
[Owl City:]
I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fire flies
Pack your bags it's time to go
Cause we got brighter lights back home

[Jake Owen:]
I've got aching feet
From walking over miles of concrete
And I can't wait to dream
But the city, you know she won't go to sleep
So I'm saying...

[Owl City:]
Goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fire flies
Pack your bags it's time to go
Cause we got brighter lights back home
Yeah, we got brighter lights

[Jake Owen:]
Back home there's a girl named Mary Lou
A diner off the highway with a corner booth
And every gravel road is a trip down memory lane
And back home, where the corn grows ten feet tall
Every year's measured on the pantry wall
The willow trees are waving 'til we come back home again

[Owl City (Jake Owen):]
I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
(To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fire flies
Pack your bags it's time to go)
Pack your bags it's time to go

[Owl City (Jake Owen):]
I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
(To bonfires and fire flies)
Pack your bags it's time to go
Pack your bags it's time to go
(Cause we got brighter lights back home)
All the thoughts in my head spinning 'round like a hurricane
And life leaves me so confused
When I trip and I fall I collapse like a tidal wave
So I'm crying out to you

You reached down out of nowhere
And picked my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore

You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) I can't live without you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) I just can't live without you

When I'm hit like a hook to the jaw in a title fight
I'm down and I'm knocked out cold, you know
And with my heart broke apart like a wreck in a shallow tide
Yeah I've never felt this low

You reached down out of nowhere
And picked my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore

You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) I can't live without you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) I just can't live without you
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
[Adam:]
Some days I barely hold on
When life drags me down
I wanna let go
But when my spirit is weak
You come to my aid
And strengthen my soul

I'm lost without You
I'll never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains, it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when you hear my prayer

You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
You're not alone!
You're not alone!

[Britt:]
Some days I just can't go on
I stumble and fall
And I hang my head
But You reach out for my hand
And You lift me up
Again and again
Oh, yes, You do

[Both:]
I'm lost without You
I'll never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains, it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when you hear my prayer
You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
You're not alone!
You're not alone!

[Adam:]
In the face of my depravity

[Britt:]
For God so loved the world He taught for me
Yeah

[Both:]
My fire burns ‘til He returns
And takes me home beyond the galaxy

[Britt:]
You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity

[Adam:]
All eternity!

[Both:]
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
You're not alone!
You're not alone!

[Britt:]
You're not
You're not alone
Never alone...
An eight year old girl had a panic attack
'Cause the father she loved left and never looked back
No longer the hero she counted on
He told her he loved her and then he was gone

She tried to look happy in front of her friends
But knew that she'd never feel normal again
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end

Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked
But nobody knew he was dying inside
He promised his family he'd be alright
And then with a gunshot he left them behind

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end, no.

The role of a father he never deserved
He abandoned his daughter and never returned
And over the years though the pain was real
She finally forgave him and started to heal

How close is the ending, well, nobody knows
The future's a mystery and anything goes
Love is confusing and life is hard
You fight to survive 'cause you made it this far

It's all too astounding to comprehend
It's just the beginning this isn't the end
It's just the beginning this isn't the end

Feels like I've been away for a thousand years
So tired of these airports and souvenirs
I shiver in the night and I think of you

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align (when I'm in Tokyo)
You keep me on my toes
And this is how it goes
You never leave my mind

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset
I love the most
When I'm in Tokyo
I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast
When I'm in Tokyo
Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo

I wander all alone in the pouring rain
Ride shotgun on the wind in a bullet train
I shiver in the night and I think of you

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align
You keep me on my toes
And this is how it goes
You never leave my mind

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset
I love the most
When I'm in Tokyo
I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast
When I'm in Tokyo
Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align
You keep me on my toes
And this is how it goes
You never leave my mind

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset
I love the most

I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast

Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)
Got an email at 22
Told me I could be a star
On a plane for the first time
I couldn't wait to start

Landed at JFK
Father Christmas picked me up
Checked in to a dream hotel
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"

I walked in to my interview
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"
And oh, if I only knew then what I know now
I'd stand like a one man band
And I'd say "All this is new to me, but here's how it's gonna be"

And I'd say "Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye
Let me be who I wanna be"
And I'd say "Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright
Let me fly and follow my dreams"

And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all"
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a smooth talker but thanks for the Fiji Water"

Thanks for the Fiji Water

Dinner under a palmtree
I had so much on my mind
Amazed by the bright lights
I stayed up half the night

And boy, I took a leap of faith
With nowhere else to go but up
I walked in to my interview
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"

And oh, if I only knew then what I know now
I'd stand like a one man band
And I'd say "All this is new to me, but here's how it's gonna be

And I'd say "Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye
Let me be who I wanna be"
And I'd say "Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright
Let me fly and follow my dreams"

And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all"
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a spindoctor but thanks for the offer"

And "By the way, hey, thanks for the weekend"
(cause no one does it like you do)
"You know I had a ball"
(it was nice to meet you)
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a smooth talker but thanks for the Fiji Water"

Thanks for the Fiji Water

I laughed when I got back home and I thought
"There's no such thing as luck"
My mum woke my dad up
And said "it's time to leave"
So they jumped in the old Caprice
And tore off into the night
On the 4th of July

They flew through the darkness
Driving like Jehu
And they rolled into Ottumwa
Before the sun begun to rise
On the 4th of July

And in walks Bob and Janice
Rachel's on her way
To peek in through the window
Hoping to hear her grandson cry
On the 4th of July

My mother watched the fireworks
From her hospital bed
And after it was all over
She held me for the first time
On the 5th of July

I've got my mother's brown eyes
And my dad's quiet way
And Grandma Rachel's love for music
The morning I arrived
On the 5th of July

Deeping in Iowa country
And a heavenly hideaway
On the shores of Lake Rathbun
My folks brought me home
On the 5th of July

That was when (that was when)
Life began (life began)
For me
That was when (that was when)
Life began (life began)
For me

A teacher and a mechanic
Brought me into this world
They loved me with all their hearts since
The day I opened my eyes
On the 5th of July

That was when (that was when)
Life began (life began)
For me
That was when (that was when)
Life began (life began)
For me
It's been this way from the start
It's like they're always trying to tear us apart
But we will stand strong, stand true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And I'd be lying if I said that I could take any more
Cause I've been on my own, trying like never before
And I was lying on the couch and there's this knock on the door
And it's like

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah

Another day, another chance
We got our card and we're going to the dance
We're gonna stay strong, hold true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck, saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And I'd be lying if I said that we could take any more
Cause we're about to light a fire like never before
And if you're lying on the couch and there's a knock on the door
It's like

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah

We'll always be young at heart
And nothing's ever gonna tear us apart
Because we stand strong, stand true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or you know what

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah

I'm a house wren hunting for a house
I haven't found one, I'm on the lookout
For a home to call my own
A private residence
Through the grapevine I heard an empty gourd
Is hanging up somewhere on some old lady's porch
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go
To my new humble abode

I'm gonna sing
At the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am halfway home

I'm a house wren who needs a summer home
A country farm house or a quiet bungalow
Not too big, and not too small
First-rate real estate
I got my eyes peeled for a window box
An old tin can, a boot or a flower pot
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go
To my new humble abode

I'm gonna sing
At the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am half way home

I'm a house wren still hunting for a house
But I got a song and a lot to sing about
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go (off I'll go)
Because you know

I'm gonna sing
At the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
I'm on top of the world
And it's a beautiful thing

I'm gonna sing
At the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am half way home

I am half way home
He doesn't fight crime or wear a cape
He doesn't read minds or levitate
But every time my world needs saving, he's my superman
Some folks don't believe in heroes 'cause they haven't met my dad

He loves his workshop and rock and roll
He's got a hot rod and a heart of gold
And you could say he's a man of few words, but he talks a lot within
And even though I'm a little taller, I still look up to him

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

Rust-ridden fenders, and doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry till our dog died that year
He doesn't always say I love you, but I can hear him loud and clear

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

My dad's a hero to me
My dad's a hero to me
A fifteen year old kid from Saint Paul
Hopped on a train and headed west
Got a job at a Saint Mary restaurant
Washing dishes and making friends

The years went by like the seasons
And they brought him a lifetime of joy
He bought ten or twelve acres of heaven
With a paradise vantage point

And he built a cabin at the foot of the mountains
That stole his heart when he was a boy

On North Fork Road you're almost home

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever in Montana

His son worked hard in West Glacier
His daughter sold souvenirs
And he always went back to Polebridge
With his family every year

To his green tin roof in the Rockies
And his sky so full of stars
His spirit lives in these mountains
Where Montana first stole his heart

On North Fork Road you're almost home

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever in Montana

Two words on a bumper sticker
Were all I needed to read
I found myself for the first time
When Montana enchanted me

So get lost in the Big Sky country
Where adventure calls your name
Every moment is worth more than diamonds
When you spend time in the treasure state

So get lost in the Big Sky country
And let your heart lead the way
I am a light sleeper
But I am a heavy dreamer
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

And when I wander away, to some other place
I'm suddenly there, way up in the air
Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath, of beautiful dreams
My heartache it seems, so terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain

Do you believe in endless miracles?
Do you believe in the impossible?
Do you believe sleep is a time machine?
Do you believe in curiosity?
Do you believe in what you cannot see?
Do you believe life is a Lucid Dream?

Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know them by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream

Such is the path of a dreamer
I find my way by moonlight
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

And when I wander away, to some other place
I'm suddenly there, way up in the air
Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath, of beautiful dreams
My heartache it seems, so terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain

Do you believe in endless miracles?
Do you believe in the impossible?
Do you believe sleep is a time machine?
Do you believe in curiosity?
Do you believe in what you cannot see?
Do you believe life is a Lucid Dream?

Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know them by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream
Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know them by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream

I am a light sleeper
But I am a heavy dreamer
When the road is long
And your strength is gone
Remember I am just a prayer away
When the way is hard
And you are faint of heart
Remember I am just a prayer away

Hold fast, I'll guide you through the night
And fear not for I am by your side

Listen through the rain
And you can hear the angels say
Help is on the way
The moment you begin to pray
When the thunders roar
You don't need to be afraid
I'll lead you through the storm
So please remember when I say
I'm with you always

When you are worn out
And you are let down
Remember I am just a prayer away
When every door is locked
And you feel so lost
Remember I am just a prayer away

Hold fast, I'll guide you through the night
And fear not for I am by your side

Listen through the rain
And you can hear the angels say
Help is on the way
The moment you begin to pray
When the thunders roar
You don't need to be afraid
I'll lead you through the storm
So please remember when I say
I'm with you always

Come and walk with me, yeah
Come and talk with me, yeah
Soar on eagles' wings
Run and I'll be there

Listen through the rain
And you can hear the angels say
Help is on the way
The moment you begin to pray
When the thunders roar
You don't need to be afraid
I'll lead you through the storm
So please remember when I say
I'm with you always
I'm with you always
Pull the moon down with a lasso
Make your ceiling full of stars glow
I can sneak in through the window
And I could say it but we both know
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Meet the one who makes your heart stop
Find a diamond in a gift shop
Live a little, love a whole lot
And you'll be shouting from the rooftop
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Hey baby are we almost there yet?
And how much cooler could my life get?
Take my hand and take a deep breath
And we'll ride off into the sunset

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine...
Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But if your hand is in mine
I'll be floatin' on cloud nine
For the rest of my life
I'll be floatin' on cloud nine
For the rest of my life
I've had some bummer days
But I ain't lookin' back
I've made a few mistakes
But I'm on the right track

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late
Here we go

I might take my time
'Cause I find the fable had it right
Slow and steady wins the race
And I might lag behind
But I swear I'll cross the finish line
Movin' at a steady pace

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long way

The truth is hard to face
But I can take a hit
I've lost in many ways
But a winner don't quit

My head is in the game
And the move is mine to make
But I am not afraid
'Cause I'll fight the good fight

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late
Here we go

I might take my time
'Cause I find the fable had it right
Slow and steady wins the race
And I might lag behind
But I swear I'll cross the finish line
Movin' at a steady pace

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long way

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late
We bought a tent and some sleeping bags
And we jumped in the truck
North bound on I-35
Before the sun came up

We stopped for lunch in Kanow Park
Passing through the Louvre
Rolled into Bayfield, Wisconsin
And there she was
Madeline Island

We left our cares on the mainland
Boarded a ferry boat
We saw La Pointe for the first time
And we felt right at home

Drove out to Big Bay State Park
Picked out our campsite
We settled in underneath the stars
And there we were

Out there in the great Lake Superior
Right across the bay
We sat back, put our feet up and there we were
Half a world away

Where the waves turned the cliffs into sea caves
With every passing day
It was all a blur, but there we were
On Madeline Island
Madeline Island

We left our shadows on the lake shore
We soaked up all the sights
About drowned in a downpour
But for the northern lights

We shot the breeze under pine trees
And sat around the fire
We hit the hay beneath the Milky Way
And there we were

Out there in the great Lake Superior
Right across the bay
We sat back, put our feet up and there we were
Half a world away

Where the waves turned the cliffs into sea caves
With every passing day
It was all a blur, but there we were
On Madeline Island

Out there in the great Lake Superior
Right across the bay
We sat back, put our feet up and there we were
Half a world away

Where the waves turned the cliffs into sea caves
With every passing day
It was all a blur, but there we were
On Madeline Island
Madeline Island
There we were on Madeline Island

(We made a memory
That will always last
But we went on that trip
Just the three and back)
In a basement of an empty house
I slept on the floor like a vagrant
I braved a Minnesota winter night
And drove to a movie feeling lonely
And as I thawed my heart out by the light
Of the silver screen
I was unaware that you were there In the dark
A silhouette was climbing up the stairs

And what I thought in the parking lot
Was like I just wanna know your name
I drove away with not much to say
But in my hand I held the paper bird
And written on it were the words
"Be brave"

Wildflower knew I wasn't well
But on the kitchen floor I got better again
I grabbed my keys and drove toward a star
And there I was understood for the first time in my life
Cause that's when I was introduced to true serendipity
I knew it when you showed up again
In the snow yeah I was always told
Your heart is where you're home

And what I thought in the coffee shop
Was like the last eight hours was a dream
I drove away with not much to say
But in my hand I held a paper bird
And written on it were the words

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
"OK, I'll be brave"

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
"OK, I'll be brave"

And in my mind
After all this time I think
"Ain't life beautiful and strange?"
I'm blown away
With no words to say
Cause I'll forever be amazed
How I learned the meaning of the phrase
"Be brave"
"Be brave"
"Be brave"
"Be brave"
I'm digging through the glove box
I thought I had a map in here
The driver's door doesn't lock
I bought the car my junior year
There's candy in my backpack
And you can pick our soundtrack
We're heading for the East Coast tonight
So pack your bags and hold on tight
Cuz we're taking off

We're taking off

Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me
And say hello to New York City

Feet up on the dashboard
We're driving with the windows down
Did you forget your phone cord?
We'll buy one in the next small town
Get dinner at an IHOP
A shower at a truck stop
We'll listen to some Johnny Cash
Take my hand and don't look back
Cuz we're movin' on
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
We're movin' on
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me
And say hello to New York City

Run away
Run away
Run away
Run away

Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me

Stroll the midtown streets
And tell me that you don't feel giddy
Lady Liberty
Ain't throwing us a wink or is she
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me
And say hello to New York City
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Say hello to New York City
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Say hello to New York City
We used to talk all night and not say a word
When I would hop into your red Firebird
And, man alive, we would drive just to drive around town
'Cause in your car we understood and figured out
That everything changes
Everything changes

Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past
But it's alright, cause everything changes

A basement full of boys building homemade bombs
AJ cut his finger and said "go get your mom"
I saw it all through the windshield of my white truck, Troy
Lotsa ups, lotsa downs, lots of growing up
'Cause everything changes
Everything changes

Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past
But it's alright, cause everything changes

Hey Billy, remember when
It was just us (it was just us)
Pretending we were Nash and Coral
On the school bus (on the school bus)
I wouldn't change a thing, 'cause everything changes (changes...)

Life is different now and that's okay with me
I moved away and you started a family
But deep inside you and I are still the same kids
'Cause you're my brother and that won't ever change
Even though everything changes

Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past
But it's alright, yeah it's alright

There's a new guest room in my parents' home
The carpet got replaced a couple years ago
Because it isn't my bedroom anymore
There's new photographs on the freezer door
But it's alright, 'cause everything changes

(Everything changes)
We should talk all night and not say a word
('Cause everything changes)

You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, "Something's out there"
Floating in a summer sky
99 red balloons go by

99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In the dust there was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here
Here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go
It gets cold the moment you close your eyes and so terribly dark.
It gets cold the moment I feel your pulse with no blood in your heart.

Dream when you drift of tonight and followed me home.

It gets cold the moment you see the light with no love in your heart.
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you.
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you.
Ohohoh, everynight.

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go
Spread your tiny wings cuz you're flying high
Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive

You make me feel alive

It gets real the moment you lose your grip and life tears you apart.
It gets real the moment you see the light with no love in your heart.

Dream when you drift of tonight and followed me home.

Ohohoh everynight I can feel you,
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you
Ohohoh everynight

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go, spread your tiny wings cos you're flying high
Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive.

You make me feel alive

(you make me feel alive)

Ohohoh everynight I can feel you,
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone.
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you,
Ohohoh everynight..

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go, spread your tiny wings cos you're flying high

Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive [x3]

You make me feel alive [x2]
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Remember to breathe 'cause it'll take your breath away,
When the engines cough,
And you blast off.
Ignite the night with a firecracker flash.

Remember to live 'cause you're gonna be thrilled to death,
When the stars collide,
And your eyes grow wide.
Take it in with your breath against the glass.

Remember to dream 'cause it's gonna be a starry night
Over every town
As you look down.
So harmonize with the singing satellites.

And remember to scream 'cause you're gonna be lost for words,
When the sparks erupt
And they light you up.
Dip your toes in the galaxy 'cause it's yours to explore tonight.

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Roller-coaster through the atmosphere.
I'm drowning in this starry serenade,
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier.
My imagination's taking me away.

Reverie whisper in my ear.
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid.
Roller-coaster through the atmosphere.
My imagination's taking me away.

Let's hear it for the Universe
Where it never hurts
Diving in head-first.
Take a taste of the melting Milky Way.

And remember to laugh 'cause you're living in a crazy world
Where you'll never guess
What could happen next.
Give the outer limits my regards as you float to fly away.

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

In the alligator sky.
In the alligator sky.
In the alligator sky.
When I’m dressed to the nines
I’m just a shirt and tie
With a taste for prestige
And beautiful mystery
But clever girls dressed to kill
Are pretty bittersweet
And better suited for grief
Than beautiful mystery
Oh beautiful mystery
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
She enjoys it the most
With flowers in her hair
Dressing up like a ghost
For beautiful mystery
And so I kiss her goodnight
And stumble from the room
Mighty high on mystique
And beautiful mystery
Oh beautiful mystery
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you

Is it a kind of dream,
Floating out on the tide,
Following the river of death downstream?
Oh, is it a dream?

There's a fog along the horizon,
A strange glow in the sky,
And nobody seems to know where you go,
And what does it mean?
Oh, is it a dream?

Bright eyes,
Burning like fire.
Bright eyes,
How can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes.

Is it a kind of shadow,
Reaching into the night,
Wandering over the hills unseen,
Or is it a dream?

There's a high wind in the trees,
A cold sound in the air,
And nobody ever knows when you go,
And where do you start,
Oh, into the dark.

Bright eyes,
burning like fire.
Bright eyes,
how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes.

Bright eyes,
burning like fire.
Bright eyes,
how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes.
I woke up with the sun today
Rolled out of bed and said
"I'm gonna have some fun today"
And that's just what I did

The birds were singing, "Come outside"
I felt giddy like a kid
If life is like a swimming pool
You know I'm jumping in

We've got the perfect summer day
So put me in your plans
You know that
This doesn't happen every day
So everybody, clap your hands

Cause when we
Raise 'em high, every hand in the sky
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Shout it out, make some noise, make it loud
Soaking up the lovely weather
Everything just comes together

I woke up feeling good today
My journey has begun
I gotta give a shout-out to
The green grass and the sun

It's a long way off, a tricky shot
But I know it can be done
Another day, another game
Another hole in one
Yeah!

We've got the perfect summer day
So put me in your plans
You know that
This doesn't happen every day
So everybody, clap your hands

Cause when we
Raise 'em high, every hand in the sky
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Shout it out, make some noise, make it loud
Soaking up the lovely weather
Everything just comes together

Lift 'em up, all our hands, all at once
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Keep 'em there, all our hands, in the air
We're wishing it could last forever
Baby, put your hands together

The weather's just so fine
Wish I could bottle time
'Cause if you only pause
You'll hear the crowd applaud
They're cheering for you now
Stand up and take a bow
You know that you deserve it
Today is picture perfect

Raise 'em high, every hand in the sky
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Shout it out, make some noise, make it loud
Soaking up the lovely weather
Everything just comes together

Clap our hands! Clap our hands! Clap our hands!
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Clap our hands! Clap our hands! Clap our hands!
We're wishing it could last forever
Baby, put your hands together

That's why we clap our hands
That's why we clap our hands
Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of thy redeeming love

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by thy help I come
And I hope by thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wondering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let thy goodness like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to thee

Cause prone to wander Lord I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, o take and seal it,
Seal it for thy courts above

Unto you, I pledge my love

There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wondered till I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

And this is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you too
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew...

This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
Taylor, I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

I was never in love with someone else
I never had somebody waiting on me
'Cause you were all of my dreams come true
And I just wish you knew
Taylor, I was so in love with you
I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
But no one recognized me, I didn’t look the same

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

People came from miles around and everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
And over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan’s shoes, wearing his disguise

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

I played them all the old songs, I thought that’s why they came
But no one heard the music, we didn’t look the same
I said hello to Mary Lou, she belongs to me
And when I sang a song about a Honky Tonk, it was time to leave

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Good
Playing guitar like ringing a bell and looking like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lot of luck
But if memories were all I sang, I’d rather drive a truck

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

You can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself
I was a hot mess
In my Sunday best
Black tears in my eyes
You were my first love
You were my only one
I can't believe your lies

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

You got a new friend
You like to play pretend
I'm just keepin' my cool
Turn on the smoke machine
Magic and make believe
She'll never know you like I do

Once we were a fire burnin'
Now you're just a lesson I'm learning

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

I know that I can find somebody
You won't ever find nobody else like me
[4x]

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

I gotta say goodbye
This isn't easy
I gotta say goodbye

Everywhere, everybody needs a neighbor
Showing up when times get hard
But there's friends of sons and daughters
Saying grace without supper in your backyard
Who doesn't wanna be a hero?
At least a little bit of helping out
There's something you're never gonna help or change
But hunger's something we can turn around
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Showing up at your front door
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah what's everybody looking for
Here's your one chance to make a difference
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand
There's room at the table for more
Yeah here's hope.. Yeah here's hope
There's a small town girl in third grade
Making sure her sisters get enough
She sees her mama working two jobs
Worrying and crying, doing everything but giving up
If a miracle's a gift when you need it
Then it's time for stepping in
Here's to families and kids
Wherever you live
Never ever wondering again

Here's hope (Here's hope)
Showing up at your front door
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah what's everybody looking for
Here's your one chance to make a difference
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand
There's room at the table for more
Yeah here's hope
Here's to going to bed not hungry
Here's to changing the story
Here's to bigger heart and brighter days
Let me hear you sing it for me
Let me hear you sing it for me
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Showing up at your front door
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah what's everybody looking for
Here's your one chance to make a difference
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand
There's room at the table for more
Yeah here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah here's hope
Hey Anna, he’s just a boy you won’t understand if you try
So, hey Anna, smile when he’s holding your hand tonight
Hey Anna, remember when you’re wishing away your life
Hey, hey Anna, everything is going to turn out just fine

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh

Such a hot crush
Makes your face blush,
But try to take your time

‘Cause every goose chase
Makes your heart race
And then you wonder why?

So wait for the home run,
You’ll find the right one
And you’ll figure this all out

Life is a mind game
Love is a blind date
And it’s making your heart pound

Hey Anna, he’s just a boy you won’t understand if you try
So, hey Anna, smile when he’s holding your hand tonight
Hey Anna, remember when you’re wishing away your life
Hey, hey Anna, everything is going to turn out just fine

Waking up sad
Isn’t so bad
If you look outside

‘Cause all the signs say
That it’s a new day
And you were so alive

So wait for the home run,
You’ll find the right one
And you’ll figure this all out

Life is a mind game
Love is a blind date
And it’s making your heart pound

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh

Hey Anna, he’s just a boy you won’t understand if you try
So, hey Anna, smile when he’s holding your hand tonight
Hey Anna, remember when you’re wishing away your life
Hey, hey Anna, everything is going to turn out just fine

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Just around the corner there’s heartaches
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
I walk and cry while my heart beat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun don’t shine through this window of mine
‘Cause it’s dark at the home of the blues

Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
And dreams that I’ve had left me feeling so bad
I just wanna give up and lay down and die

So if you just lost your sweetheart
And it seems that there’s no good way to choose
Well come along with me, misery loves company
And you’re welcome at the home of the blues
‘Cause just around the corner there’s heartaches
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
You’re gonna find me at the home of the blues

How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
And make a wretch His treasure.

How great the pain of searing loss.
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.

Behold the Man upon the cross.
My sin upon His shoulder.
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished.
His dying breath has brought me life.
I know that it is finished.

I will not boast in anything:
No gifts, no power, no wisdom,
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.

This I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.
That moment the first few flakes start falling
Is the moment before I burst into tears
'Cause snow in the air means Christmas shopping
And the thought of it all just stresses me out
Wo-oh-oe is me
Wo-oh-oe is me

Would she kinda like this canary yellow?
Or does she already own way too many scarves?
I could get her a backpack and something to carry
This is way too much pressure, it's breaking my heart
Wo-oh-oe is me
Wo-oh-oe is me

I'm ready to wrap that perfect Christmas gift
But I haven't found it yet
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
So I'll give you my heart
I wander around the store again and again
But all I do is shrug
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
And I'm ready to say, "Bah humbug"!
(Bah bah bah bah [x4])
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah humbug
(Bah bah bah bah [x4])
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah

I could get her a gift card to Olive Garden
But what if Red Lobster is way more her thing?
I don't even know
Well how 'bout a bike, or like a ukelele?
Or how 'bout I jump out the window? (window [x4])
Yeah, how 'bout I jump out the window? (window [x4])
Singing 'Joy to the World' face down in the snow!

I'm ready to wrap that perfect Christmas gift
But I haven't found it yet
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
So I'll give you my heart, I hope it'll do
I wander around the store again and again
But all I do is shrug
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
And I'm ready to say

I'll wrap myself in paper and sit under the tree
'Cause the best gift I can give you is this heart inside of me!

I'm ready to wrap that perfect Christmas gift
But I ain't found it yet!
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you (here's my heart)
So I'll give you my heart, I hope it'll do
I wander around the store again and again
But all I do is shrug
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
And I'm 'bout ready to say, "Bah humbug!"

(Bah bah bah bah [x4])
Sorry for the hand towels!
Bah humbug!
(Bah bah bah bah [x4])
Sorry for the Yankee candles!
Bah humbug!
(Bah bah bah bah [x2])
Sorry for all this useless junk!
The best gift I have to give
Is my love

(Huh. I hate shopping)

She wound a thread around the pieces of my broken heart
And left me to believe
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave

A starry night without a fear of heights
I can't recall, 'cause I learned after all
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

Da da da da da da daaaaa
Da da da da da da daaaaa (girls, girls don't wanna leave)

I miss the way she whispered in my ear
Before she left, had me so convinced
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave

And Juliet's romantic balcony
Wears out the wall, but I learned after all
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

When you're alone
I hope my ghost never leaves
'Cause when I'm home
Your painful memory is always haunting me

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing me

When I see you around, my eyes go wide
When you race through my mind, I die inside
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa

There’s more that rises in the morning than the sun
And more that shines in the night than just the moon
It’s more than this fire here that keeps me warm
In a shelter that is larger than this room

And there’s a loyalty that’s deeper than mere sentiments
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing
The stuff of earth competes with allegiance
I owe only to the Giver of all good things

So if I stand let me stand on the promise
That You will pull me through
And if I can’t let me fall on the grace
That first brought me to You

And if I sing let me sing for the joy
That has born in me these songs
And if I weep let it be
As a man who is longing for his home
Oh, yeah

There’s more that dances on the prairies than the wind
And more that pulses in the ocean than the tide
There’s a love that’s fiercer than the love between friends
More gentle than a mother’s when her baby’s at her side

And there’s a loyalty that’s deeper than mere sentiments
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing
The stuff of earth competes with allegiance
I owe only to the Giver of all good things

So if I stand let me stand on the promise
That You will pull me through
And if I can’t let me fall on the grace
That first brought me to You

And if I sing let me sing for the joy
That has born in me these songs
And if I weep let it be
As a man who is longing for his home
Oh

So if I stand let me stand on the promise
That You will pull me through
And if I can’t let me fall on the grace
That first brought me to You

And if I sing let me sing for the joy
That has born in me these songs
And if I weep let it be
As a man who is longing for his home

And if I weep let it be
As a man who is longing for his home
In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
this Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
here in the love of Christ I stand.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain:
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine -
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath.
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in power of Christ I'll stand.
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
Well it's Christmas time
And I'm warm inside
Despite the bitter cold
Cause you're here with me
And I guarantee
My heart is yours to hold

So we smile below
This mistletoe
As if we need a hint
And the falling snow
Well I bet it knows
How love can pull you in

Oh-ohh oh!

Little lights flash in your eyes
Glowing by the fireside
Leave the presents on the floor
Cause you're the one I'm waiting for

Despite the bitter cold
And it's crystal clear
That this Christmas cheer
Is healthy for the soul

Cause you're the one I'm waiting for

Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time
Build a snowman with the wind at his back
Got the day planned and presents to wrap
Fight the wind chill with all of my friends
'Cause it's Christmas time again

Going downtown and spreading good cheer
Handing gloves out when we volunteer
For the children, grinnin' from ear to ear
Singing Christmas time is here

And everybody's like ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho
Four-wheel driving through the snow
Fighting the cold with some hot cocoa
Grabbing grandma, to the mall we go

And there's a man outside with a bucket and a bell
Wants to go home with a story to tell
And he's reminding us
That his Christmas got nothing to do
With living for himself.
It's the...

[2x]
Light of Christmas shining through
Our eyes, our smiles, you know it could shine on through
All the good that we do for the people that don't have it so good

Light me up and I'll show you the way
Every year can't wait for Christmas day
Light me up, I finally figured out
What Christmas is all about

Oh oh, oh oh oh [2x]

Here's a gift card for your new winter coat
'Cause the backyard is covered with snow
And the sleigh rides, they don't cost a cent
Yeah, it's Christmas time again

[2x]
Light of Christmas shining through
Our eyes, our smiles, you know it could shine on through
All the good that we do for the people that don't have it so good

Light me up and I'll show you the way
Every year can't wait for Christmas day
Light me up, I finally figured out
What Christmas is all about

[2x]
Do you hear the sound?
A thousand angels are singing out
To God Almighty we're bowing down
And that's what Christmas is all about

Light me up and I'll show you the way
Every year can't wait for Christmas day
Light me up, I finally figured out
What Christmas is all about

And everybody's like

[2x]
Light of Christmas shining through

All the good that we do for the people that don't have it so good

Light me up, I finally figured out
What Christmas is all about
(For the people that don't have it so good)
I finally figured out
What Christmas is all about
All right, okay, he-he-he
Very good to see you down in New Orleans, man
Yeah, here it is, yeah, yeah

Any time, any day
You can hear the people say that love is blind
Well, I don't know, but I say love is kind
Du-du-du...

Soldier boy kisses girl
Leaves behind a tragic world
But he won't mind
He's in love and he says love is fine
Duh duh duh duh
Uh duh duh duh duh
Duh duh duh

Oh - yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?

He said
(Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo)
Ah, take it away!

Oh - yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said

The wonder of it all baby
The wonder of it all baby
The wonder of it all baby

(Lets Live It Up, Lets Live It Up, Lets Live It Up, Lets Live It Up)

Lead the way, and lets get it started,
Seize the day, and reach for the sky,
Carry on, 'cause those broken hearted days are gone,
So wave good bye,

We're gonna blow up because we've got nothing to lose,
We're gonna rise up above when we've break all the rules,
We're gonna re-write the book 'cause its long over-due,

Well I’ve been huddled up alone
By the fire even though
I’m not exactly feeling cold
And I’ve been bundled up for days
Too confused to be amazed
At all the icy water in my veins
Why do I feel so alone?
Yeah I’ve been moving in and out
Of this old split-level house
And I’d just as soon burn the whole place down
‘Cause I quit working lumberyards
To build a mansion out of cards
But I feel thin behind these paper walls
Why do I feel so alone?
‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite
Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn’t invite
But if the prettiest romance isn’t perfectly right
That makes every love lost just a holiday every night
Well I’ve been painting through the night
In the basement out of sight
Brushing paper tigers black and white
‘Cause come tomorrow afternoon
I’ll fill a helium balloon
And set them free into the baby blue sky
So they won’t have to be alone
‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite
Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn’t invite
But if the prettiest romance isn’t perfectly right
That makes every love lost just a holiday every night
But when I close these heavy lids after dark
Each sweet dream is a target
And all my shots are so consistently wide of the mark
‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite
Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn’t invite
But if the prettiest romance isn’t perfectly right
That makes every love lost just a holiday every night
Just a holiday every night
Just a holiday every night
Just a holiday every night
Well I’ve been huddled up alone
By the fire even though
I’m not exactly feeling cold
But how my heartache hit the trail
When a paper tiger tail
Fluttered down, I guess I’ll never know
There's the snow
Look out below
And bundle up
Cause here it comes
Run outside
So starry eyed
A snowball fight breaks out
And winter has finally begun

I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace
Till I slip on the sidewalk and fall on my face
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet
I don't need to taste to believe
What's December without Christmas Eve

Hop in the sleigh
And we'll glide away
Into the night
And we'll sip on moonlight
Runny nose
My frosty toes
Are getting cold but I feel alive
So I smile wide

The snowflakes start falling and I start to float
Till my mean older brother stuffs snow down my coat
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet
I don't need to taste to believe
What's December without Christmas Eve

All this holiday cheer
Heaven knows where it goes
But it returns every year
And though this winter does nothing but storm
The joy in my heart is ablaze and it's keeping me warm
It's keeping me warm
It's keeping me warm

I rip off the wrapping and tear through the box
Till I end up with 45 new pairs of socks
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet
I don't need to taste to believe
What's December without Christmas Eve


Just before the dawn,
When the light's still gone,
Shine, shine your way,
And you may not know, where to go,
Shine, shine your way

Open road but it's still dark,
Build a fire from a spark,
And shine, shine your way,
Feed the feeling in your heart,
Don't conceal it then you'll start,
To find, find your way

No one can stop, what has begun,
You must believe when I say

All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,
Starting today,
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way

There's an open sky,
And a reason why,
You shine, shine your way,
There's so much to learn,
And now it's your turn,
To shine, shine your way

There's a feeling deep inside,
You can let it be your guide,
To find, find your way,
And there's no time for us to waste,
Got to take a leap of faith,
And fly, fly away

Don't have to walk,
Now you can run,
Nothing can get in your way

All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,
Starting today,
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way

Morning is breaking,
Darkness is fading,
We found a way to the light,
It's such a beautiful sight

Any time, anywhere,
Turn around and I'll be there,
To shine, shine your way

Like a star burning bright,
Lighting up the darkest night,
I'll shine, shine your way

Now I can see,
You are the one,
Sent here to show me the way

All of our tears will dry faster in the sun,
Starting today,
Shine, shine, shine,
We're on our way,
Shine, shine, shine,
That's what we say,
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way

There's a reason why
You shine, shine your way

All of our tears will dry faster in the sun
Shine your way



You and me thick as thieves,
Parachute like falling leaves.
A million miles can not divide,
My heart from yours and yours from mine.

When the space gets longer,
The stars get stronger.
If we ever get lost, we can find a way, we can find a way.
There's not a road that I wouldn't ponder (Ponder.... [x3])

Up All Night,
Can't got to sleep with you by my side.
I turn the light on when I see a trace of my pillow talker.
Without you I'm just a Sleepwalker.
I don't know where I am,
I'm falling down the stairs.
I'm looking everywhere, everywhere.
Up all night,
I'd be a goner.
Without you I'm just a Sleepwalker.

I tried to find you in my dreams,
2000 leagues under the sea.
(I tried to find you in my dreams
2000 leagues under the sea).

Up against the looking glass,
I see the memories of our past.
(Up against the looking glass,
I see the memories of our past).

'Cause when the waves get longer,
The sky gets smaller.
If we ever get lost, gotta find a way, gotta find a way
Into the ocean your river wanders (wanders.... [x3])

Up All Night,
Can't got to sleep with you by my side.
I turn the light on when I see a trace of my pillow talker.
Without you I'm just a sleepwalker.
I don't know where I am,
I'm falling down the stairs.
I'm looking everywhere everywhere.
Up all night,
I'd be a goner.
Without you I'm just a sleepwalker.

(Sleepwalker...Sleepwalker...)

Up All Night,
Can't got to sleep with you by my side.
I turn the light on when I see a trace of my pillow talker.
Without you I'm just a sleepwalker.
I don't know where I am,
I'm falling down the stairs.
I'm looking everywhere everywhere.
Up all night,
I'd be a goner.
Without you I'm just a sleepwalker.

(Sleepwalker...Sleepwalker...)
It's Christmas and we walk alone
Two strangers with no one to miss us
On our own, out in the cold

Trudging onward, braving a harsh winter storm
You and I met passing by, and now our spirits feel warm

I don't have anyone at home to talk to
And you don't have anything to do
So I'll spend my Christmas with you

(ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba) [x2]

I'll spend my Christmas with you

(ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba) [x2]

It's Christmas and we are in love
With the way that the soft snowflakes kiss us
From far above the blustery breeze

Trudging onward, braving a harsh winter storm
You and I met passing by, and now our spirits feel warm

I believe that Jesus is truly the only way
And I celebrate Christmas because it's his birthday
(it's his birthday)

I don't have anyone at home to talk to
And you don't have anything to do
So I'll spend my Christmas with you

(ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba) [x12]

I'll spend my Christmas with you
I'll spend my Christmas with you (ooh, ooh...)
I'll spend my Christmas with you (ooh, ooh...)
I'll spend my Christmas with you (ooh, ooh...)
I'm the snow
Look out below
And bundle up
'Cause here I come

Skies of grey
This holiday
But spirits shine so bright
They don't need the sun

'Cause love is the fire
In your fireplace
And carefree are the snowflakes
That fall on your face

And although this winter
May bring us a storm
The joy in your heart
Keeps you warm
Yeah, the joy in your heart
Keeps you warm
Weak and wounded sinner
Lost and left to die
O, raise your head for love is passing by
Now your burden's lifted
And carried far away
And precious blood has washed away the stain

sing to Jesus
Sing to Jesus
Sing to Jesus and live

And like a new born baby
Don't be afraid to crawl
And remember when you walk sometimes you fall

So fall on Jesus
Fall on Jesus
Fall on Jesus and live

Sometimes the way is lonely
And steep and filled with pain
So if your sky is dark and pours the rain

Then cry to Jesus
Cry to Jesus
Cry to Jesus and live

Oh, and when the love spills over
And music fills the night
And when you can't contain your joy inside

Then dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus and live

And with your final heartbeat
Kiss the world goodbye
Then go in peace and laugh on glory's side

And fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus and live

Fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus and live
I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me

Give them no reason to stare
No slipping up if you slip away
So I got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
I'm waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?

We start with stars in our eyes
We start believing that we belong
But every sun doesn't rise
And no one tells you where you went wrong

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see, is anybody waving?

When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
It's like I never made a sound
Will I ever make a sound?

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me? (Ooh)

Is anybody waving?
Waving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Wonder if I gave an Oreo to the Big Bad Wolf,
how would the story go?
Would he still go huff and puff
or would he bring those pigs cool stuff
to decorate the deck he helped them build?
Would they not get killed?

Wonder if I gave an Oreo to a vampire in a creepy show,
would he not act so undead?
Would he thirst for milk instead?
I've just got this feeling that it might work out all right.

‘Cause cream does wondrous things
inside a chocolate sandwich dream.

If I gave 'em to great white sharks,
would they share 'em with baby seals?
Would they call up a giant squid for a friendly meal?
Wonder if I gave an Oreo…
Wonder if I gave an Oreo…
What if I gave an Oreo to you?y
